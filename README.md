### Project Title
Post Your Work on GitHub

### Description
In this project, I will create a GitHub repository and my local repository. I will work on a repo for my BikeShare project which I have completed before, will be making multiple branches, making edits to files on those branches (e.g., a readme file and my Python code), and then I will commit the changes to my remote repository.

### Files used
Three city dataset files were used to explore the bikeshare data:
• chicago.csv
• new_york_city.csv
• washington.csv
• [Udacity GitHub Repo](https://github.com/F-Zarian/pdsnd_github)
